If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample or an executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test` in the appropriate directory).
4.  Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint` in the appropriate directory).
5.  Issue that pull request!
